Looking at the Magnolia blossom on Kenwood Estate, NW3 7JR on Sunday 20th March 2016. 
<br />
Meet at the north side of Kenwood House near its main entrance at 11am.
<br />
The gardens around Kenwood Estate have a good variety of Magnolia species, most of them will hopefully be in flower. Time permitting, we will look at other trees.
<br />
In the case of bad weather, please check with me before setting off.
<br />
Caf√© and toilet facilities are available.</body></html>
